## 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

question:
1. must it return a solution?(if root is null, what should I return?)
2. is this order traversal meaning odd level is left to right, and even level is right to left.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]

Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
